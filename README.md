# Python Crash Course Solutions and Notes
Solutions to the 'TRY IT YOURSELF' excercises for the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes (3rd ed.) 

I will be posting here my solutions to the simple excercises that appear throughout this book, and also the notes I make of the fundamental programming concepts. These are very simple programs with little to no use outside of the context of the textbook, but might help somebody who is studying it. At the top of each program, I have pasted the exercise statement, whose credit belongs to the book's author. Everything else I have written and can be used in any way.

To run any of the programs posted here, just type in the command line: 
```
python3 [program_name.py]
```
