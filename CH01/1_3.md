**Infinite Skills**: If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build?
You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll
have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief
descriptions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas”
notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take
a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.

1) An implementation of the Mehen board game. 

2) A good daily/monthly habits tracker.

3) A program that can digitalize my notes (including drawings, math formulas and so on).
