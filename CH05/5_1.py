# 5-1
# Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# â€¢Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
#  evaluates to True or False.
# â€¢Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another  
#  5 tests evaluate to False.
