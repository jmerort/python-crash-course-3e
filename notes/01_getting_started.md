# 1 - Getting started
You can run lines of Python code using the interpreter from a terminal window, instead of writing and running a whole program.

To install Python, first check if it's already installed by typing `python3` if you're on Linux or Mac and `python` if you're on Windows in the command line/terminal application. If it isn't installed, or if you want a newer version, go to https://python.org and look for the downloads section, where the installer should be.

To write and run Python programs on VSCode, first install the Python extension provided by Microsoft. 

Python files have a .py extension.

To run a python file press the run symbol on VSCode or run 
```
python3 program.py
```
on the command line.
