# 3-5
# Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
# dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
# someone else to invite.
# •Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print() call at the end of
#  your program, stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
# •Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the
#  name of the new person you are inviting.
# •Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in
#  your list.
