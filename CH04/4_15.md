Code Review: Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter
and modify each one to comply with PEP 8.
•Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert four
spaces every time you press the TAB key, if you haven’t already done so
(see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
•Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a
vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
•Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.


I had to shorten some lines but, for the most part, the programs were already
PEP-8-compliant.
